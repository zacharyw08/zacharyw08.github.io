      <description> Hello there, This is my first blog post on this project. It contains python code and output, as well as a demonstration with reticulate that shows how R and python can share information with each other across code chunks.

      <description>By: Zachary Wong zpw97  Introduction The dataset that I chose for this project relates to the efficiency statistics of NBA players. This dataset is one of the datasets that I used for project 1, which I chose because I am a huge basketball fan and enjoy researching how players contribute to the team through their statistics. The specific dataset came from the Five Thirty Eight website, which provides many datasets related to sports, politics, economics, and more.</description>

      <description>By: Zachary Wong zpw97  Introduction The datasets that I chose for this project relate to NBA basketball players. I chose these because I am a huge fan of sports, especially basketball. I often find myself watching games and intensely evaluating box scores for players&#39; statistics. I find it incredibly interesting to see how players statistics (points, rebounds, assists) fluctuate over the course of the season and throughout their careers.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>
