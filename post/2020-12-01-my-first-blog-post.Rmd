####Hello there,

This is my first blog post on this project. It contains python code and output, as well as a demonstration with reticulate that shows how R and python can share information with each other across code chunks.

###Python
```{python}
string="mystring yay!"
import re
re.findall(r"y",string)

```


###Reticulate
```{r}

```

```{python}

```


###Dog Picture
Enjoy this picture of my dog posing with some bluebonnets!
